## How to download The JEMM Source Code ?
Are you passionate about open-source projects? Curious to see how JEMM works under the hood? The full source code is available on GitHub—and it's waiting for you! Whether you want to explore the architecture, customize it for your own Jellyfin setup, or contribute with new ideas, bug fixes, or improvements, you're more than welcome.

🔗 Clone it, fork it, build it, break it (just a little), and make it better! JEMM is built with Java 11 and Maven, and it plays nicely with most IDEs—NetBeans, IntelliJ, Eclipse, you name it.
