## What's Jellyfin Easy Metadata Manager ? ##

Jellyfin Easy Metadata Manager (JEMM) is a free and open-source tool designed to assist advanced users of the [Jellyfin Project](https://jellyfin.org/) in managing their media server instances more efficiently.

The primary goal of JEMM is to simplify the process of editing and completing metadata fields for library items and folders—making your media collection more organized, searchable, and visually appealing.

With JEMM, you can easily replicate the same metadata fields defined in a folder to the child-items, export and import metada from CSV files, print some reports about your media-inventory and others nice things! You can make just a little metadata update or make big changes massivelly!

## What's Jellyfin Metadata ?##
Jellyfin metadata refers to the descriptive information associated with your media library items—such as movies, TV shows, music, and folders. This data helps Jellyfin organize, display, and enhance your media collection with rich details and visuals.

Metadata can include:

- 🎬 Title, release year, and genre
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Cast and crew information
- 📝 Plot summaries and episode descriptions
- 🌐 Language, country, and ratings
- 🖼️ Cover art, posters, and fan art
- 📁 Folder names and custom tags

Jellyfin can automatically fetch metadata from online sources, or you can manually edit it to ensure accuracy and personalization using JEMM. Well-maintained metadata improves searchability, browsing experience, and the overall look and feel of your Jellyfin interface.

JEMM was created to make this metadata editing process easier, faster, and more intuitive for users who want full control over their media library.
