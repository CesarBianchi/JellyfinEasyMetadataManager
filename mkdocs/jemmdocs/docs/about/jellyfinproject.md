# ðŸŒŸ Discover the Jellyfin Project

Jellyfin is more than just a media serverâ€”it's a movement. Born from the passion of the open-source community, Jellyfin empowers you to take full control of your media experience, free from subscriptions, limitations, or corporate walls.

Whether you're streaming movies, organizing your music, or managing family photo albums, Jellyfin gives you the tools to build your own personal entertainment hubâ€”secure, customizable, and entirely yours.

## ðŸŽ¬ No paywalls. No tracking. No compromises.##
 Jellyfin is built by people who believe in digital freedom and user-first design. Itâ€™s constantly evolving thanks to a vibrant community of developers, translators, testers, and everyday users who share a love for open technology.

ðŸ’¡ Want to contribute? You donâ€™t need to be a coding wizard. Every bug report, feature suggestion, translation, or documentation tweak helps Jellyfin grow stronger.

Jellyfin is proof that when people come together around a shared vision, amazing things happen. Your media. Your server. Your rules.
