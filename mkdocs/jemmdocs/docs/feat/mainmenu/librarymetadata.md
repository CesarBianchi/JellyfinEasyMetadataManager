# 3. The "Library Metadata" sheet #

Once a library is selected, the Library Metadata Sheet shows detailed information about that **library configuration and metadata settings**. This sheet is perfect for fine-tuning how your LIBRARY is presented and organized within Jellyfin.

**Important to know:** This sheet does not display metadata details for **individual items within the library**. To view or edit metadata for specific media items ‚Äî like *movies, episodes, or albums* - head over to the **Library Content** grid. That‚Äôs where you‚Äôll find all the detailed information for each item, including titles, genres, cast, artwork, and more.

### Here you can view and edit for Library: ###
- *Library Title*
- *Sort Name*
- *Forced Sort Name*
- *Created Date*
- *Premiere Date*
- *Custom Rating*
- *Overview*

### In addition to editing basic metadata, you can also fine-tune other aspects of your **Library**, such as: ####
- *People*;
- *Genres*;
- *Studios*;
- *Tags*;

Use the left buttons **+** and **-** to help you to add these specific items


## üíæ How to Save Your Changes to the Jellyfin Server ##

After you've finished editing the metadata for your Library, it's time to save those changes to your Jellyfin server. To do this, simply click the **"Apply for Library"** button.

### When you press this button: ###

 - All the updated information from the Library Metadata Sheet will be sent directly to the corresponding library on your Jellyfin instance.

 - Your changes will be applied instantly, keeping your media collection organized and up to date.

This ensures that everything you've customized ‚Äî titles, descriptions and more ‚Äî is safely stored and reflected in Jellyfin.


## üîÅ Apply Metadata to Library and Its Items ##

To help users save time and ensure consistency, JEMM offers an extended save option called **"Apply for Library and Content"**.

### When you press this button: ###
 - JEMM not only updates the metadata for the selected Library, but also automatically applies the same metadata settings to all its child items‚Äîsuch as *movies, episodes, albums, or books* within the selected library.

This is ideal for users who want to streamline their workflow and ensure that metadata like language, artwork preferences, or source settings are consistently applied across the entire collection.

It‚Äôs a smart way to keep your Jellyfin libraries clean, unified, and beautifully organized‚Äîwith just one click.
