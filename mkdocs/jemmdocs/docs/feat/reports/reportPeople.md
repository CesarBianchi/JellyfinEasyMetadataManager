# 🧑‍🎬 People Report – Explore Your Media by Cast & Crew #

The People Report in JEMM is designed to help users analyze their media libraries based on the people involved—actors, directors, writers, musicians, and more. It’s a powerful way to understand how individuals are represented across your Jellyfin collection and to spot patterns, gaps, or inconsistencies in your metadata.

## Types of People Reports ##

Just like other reports, the People Report comes in two versions: Basic and Full

## 🧾 Basic People Report ##

The Basic version provides a simple list of all registered people found across your libraries. It’s perfect for:

- Reviewing which names are currently in use
- Identifying duplicates or misspellings
- Planning metadata cleanup or standardization

This version is lightweight and ideal for quick audits of cast and crew data.

## 🧾 Full People Report ##

The Full version offers a detailed aggregation of media items by person. You’ll see:

- Each person followed by a list of associated media
- Item-level details like title, role (e.g., actor, director), and library source
- A clear view of how each individual is represented across your collection

This report is especially useful for power users managing large Jellyfin instances who want to analyze cast distribution, track frequent collaborators, or prepare for metadata enhancements.
