# üè∑Ô∏è Tags Report ‚Äì Audit and Organize by Custom Tags #

The Tags Report in JEMM helps users explore and manage their media libraries based on custom tags assigned to items. Tags are a flexible way to group, filter, and categorize content‚Äîwhether you're organizing by themes, collections, moods, or personal preferences.

## Types of Tags Reports ##

Just like other reports, the Tags Report comes in two versions: Basic and Full

## üßæ Basic Tags Report ##

The Basic version provides a simple list of all registered tags found across your Jellyfin libraries. It‚Äôs ideal for:

- Reviewing which tags are currently in use
- Spotting duplicates, typos, or inconsistencies
- Planning tag cleanup or standardization

This version is lightweight and perfect for quick audits of your tagging system.

## üßæ Full Tags Report ##

The Full version offers a detailed aggregation of media items by tag. You‚Äôll see:

- Each tag followed by a list of associated media
- Item-level details like title, release year, and library source
- A clear view of how tags are distributed across your collection

This report is especially useful for power users managing large Jellyfin instances who want to analyze tag usage, track themed collections, or prepare for metadata enhancements.

Whether you're curating a genre-blending playlist or organizing a film archive by custom categories, the Tags Report gives you the insights you need to keep your Jellyfin libraries clean, consistent, and personalized.
