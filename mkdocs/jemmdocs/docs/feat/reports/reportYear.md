# ðŸ“… Year Report â€“ Media Distribution by Release Year #

The Year Report in JEMM offers a straightforward way to analyze your media collection based on release years. It helps users understand how their content is spread across timeâ€”whether you're tracking historical trends, curating decade-based playlists, or auditing metadata consistency.

Unlike other report types, the Year Report is available in a single version:

## ðŸ§¾ Basic Year Report ##

The Basic version provides a complete list of all registered release years found across your Jellyfin libraries, along with the number of items associated with each year.

Itâ€™s ideal for:

- Spotting metadata gaps or missing dates
- Analyzing collection density by year
- Identifying outliers or misclassified items

This report is especially useful for users who want a quick overview of how their media is distributed over timeâ€”without diving into item-level details.
