# ðŸ“¦ Bulk Metadata Management with CSV Export/Import#

Managing metadata across multiple libraries can be time-consumingâ€”especially when you need to apply consistent changes or audit large collections. Thatâ€™s why JEMM offers a powerful feature for massive metadata editing across many libraries at once.

## This feature is built around two key functions: ##
### ðŸ“¤ Export CSV Metadata ###

With just a click, you can export all existing metadata from your Jellyfin libraries into a structured CSV file. This file includes detailed information about each itemâ€”titles, genres, release years, cast, artwork links, and more.

#### Why is this useful? ####

 You get a complete snapshot of your media metadata. Itâ€™s easy to review and organize metadata records in tools like Microsoft Excel, Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, or Sublime Text

 Perfect for backups, audits, or preparing bulk edits

### ðŸ“¥ Import CSV Metadata ###

Once you've made your changes in the CSV file, you can re-import it into JEMM using the Import CSV Metadata function. JEMM will read your updated metadata and apply it across all relevant libraries and itemsâ€”automatically and efficiently.

#### This means: ####

 No need to edit items one by one or library by library throught "Library Metadata" and "Library Content" sheets.  You can apply consistent metadata rules across multiple libraries using just one CSV file

 This feature is ideal for advanced users who prefer working in text editors or spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel, Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, or Sublime Text. It gives you full flexibility to review and edit metadata in bulkâ€”outside the JEMM interface.

**ðŸ’¡ Smart editing tip:** You donâ€™t need to modify the entire CSV file. If you only want to update a few items, simply preserve only the rows youâ€™ve changed. JEMM will detect and apply updates based on the content of the imported fileâ€”making it a fast and efficient way to push targeted changes without touching your whole library.

ðŸ§  Smart, Scalable, and Time-Saving

Whether you're curating a massive movie archive or fine-tuning a music collection, this feature gives you the flexibility and control to manage metadata your wayâ€”fast, accurate, and scalable
