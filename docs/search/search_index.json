With JEMM, you can easily replicate the same metadata fields defined in a folder to the child-items, export and import metada from CSV files, print some reports about your media-inventory and others nice things! You can make just a little metadata update or make big changes massivelly! What's JEMM ? \"JEMM\" stands for \"Jellyfin Easy Metadata Manager\", a streamlined application designed to simplify metadata management for your Jellyfin media server. What's Jellyfin ? Jellyfin is a free, open-source media server that lets you collect, manage, and stream your personal media\u2014movies, TV shows, music, and more\u2014from your own server to any device, without ads or tracking. What's Jellyfin Metadata ? Jellyfin metadata refers to the descriptive information associated with your media library items\u2014such as movies, TV shows, music, and folders.

It\u2019s easy to review and organize metadata records in tools like Microsoft Excel, Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, or Sublime Text Perfect for backups, audits, or preparing bulk edits \ud83d\udce5 Import CSV Metadata Once you've made your changes in the CSV file, you can re-import it into JEMM using the Import CSV Metadata function. JEMM will read your updated metadata and apply it across all relevant libraries and items\u2014automatically and efficiently. This means: No need to edit items one by one or library by library throught \"Library Metadata\" and \"Library Content\" sheets. You can apply consistent metadata rules across multiple libraries using just one CSV file This feature is ideal for advanced users who prefer working in text editors or spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel, Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, or Sublime Text.
