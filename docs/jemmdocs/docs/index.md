# Welcome to The Jellyfin Easy Metadata Manager - User Manual

Jellyfin Easy Metadata Manager (JEMM) is a free and open-source tool designed to assist advanced users of the [Jellyfin Project](https://jellyfin.org/) in managing their media server instances more efficiently.

The primary goal of JEMM is to simplify the process of editing and completing metadata fields for library items and foldersâ€”making your media collection more organized, searchable, and visually appealing.

With JEMM, you can easily replicate the same metadata fields defined in a folder to the child-items, export and import metada from CSV files, print some reports about your media-inventory and others nice things! You can make just a little metadata update or make big changes massivelly!
