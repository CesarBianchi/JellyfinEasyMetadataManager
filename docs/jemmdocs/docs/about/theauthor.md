# Meet the Author Behind JEMM

Hi there! I'm **Cesar Bianchi**, the developer and maintainer of JEMM â€“ Jellyfin Easy Metadata Manager. I created this project to make metadata management in Jellyfin simpler, faster, and more enjoyable for everyone â€” whether you're a tech-savvy developer or just someone who loves organizing their media library.

JEMM is a labor of love, built with open-source spirit and a lot of coffee â˜•. Iâ€™m always excited to hear from fellow developers, contributors, and users who want to improve the project, share ideas, or just say hello.

Feel free to reach out to me at cesar_bianchi@hotmail.com â€” whether you want to contribute, ask questions, or support the project in any way.

Thanks for being part of the JEMM journey! ðŸ’™
