# What's Jellyfin Easy Metadata Manager ?

Jellyfin Easy Metadata Manager (Also called as "JEMM") is a free and open-source tool created to help heavy users of Jellyfin Project to manage their instances. The main purpose of JEMM is to make it easier to fill in the metadata fields of library items and folders. 

## What's Jellyfin Metadata ?
Jellyfin metadata refers to the descriptive information associated with your media library items—such as movies, TV shows, music, and folders. This data helps Jellyfin organize, display, and enhance your media collection with rich details and visuals.

Metadata can include:

- 🎬 Title, release year, and genre
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Cast and crew information
- 📝 Plot summaries and episode descriptions
- 🌐 Language, country, and ratings
- 🖼️ Cover art, posters, and fan art
- 📁 Folder names and custom tags

Jellyfin can automatically fetch metadata from online sources, or you can manually edit it to ensure accuracy and personalization using JEMM. Well-maintained metadata improves searchability, browsing experience, and the overall look and feel of your Jellyfin interface.

JEMM was created to make this metadata editing process easier, faster, and more intuitive for users who want full control over their media library.
