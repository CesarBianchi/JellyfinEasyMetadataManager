## 💙 Support JEMM and Keep It Thriving

**JEMM is a labor of love** — built to make metadata management in Jellyfin easier, faster, and more enjoyable for everyone. **As an open-source project, it’s completely free to use**, but maintaining it isn’t free.

**Behind the scenes, there are real costs:**

- 🔐 Security certificates

- 🧾 Hosting and infrastructure

- 🛠️ Development tools

- ☕ And yes, a few well-earned coffees to keep the code flowing!


If JEMM has helped you organize your media, saved you time, or simply made your Jellyfin experience better, consider making a small donation. **Every contribution —no matter the size—** helps me keep the project alive, improve features, and continue offering it to the community.

Your support means the world. Let’s build something great together. 💫
