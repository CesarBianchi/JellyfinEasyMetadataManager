# 2. Libraries List #

On the left side of the window, youâ€™ll see the **Libraries List**. This panel displays all the media libraries retrieved from your Jellyfin Server â€” Like *Movies, TV Shows, Music, Books, or any custom collections youâ€™ve created*.

Clicking on a library will load its metadata and content into the adjacent panels.
