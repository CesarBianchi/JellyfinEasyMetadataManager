# 4. The "Library Content" Sheet #

The Library Content Sheet is where you dive into the actual items within the selected library. It displays a list of media entries—movies, episodes, albums, etc.—along with key metadata fields such as:

    Title

    Release year

    Genres

    Cast and crew

    Artwork previews

You can sort, filter, and edit metadata directly from this panel, making it easy to keep your collection clean and accurate.
