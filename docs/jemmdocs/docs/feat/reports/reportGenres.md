# ðŸŽ­ Genres Report â€“ Organize and Analyze by Genre #

The Genres Report in JEMM is a powerful tool for users who want to explore and audit their media collection through the lens of genre classification. Whether you're managing movies, series, music, or books, this report helps you understand how your content is distributed across genresâ€”and spot any gaps or inconsistencies.

## Types of Genres Reports ##

There are two types of Genres Report: Basic and Full

## ðŸ§¾ Basic Genres Report ##

The Basic version provides a clean list of all registered genres found across your Jellyfin libraries. Itâ€™s ideal for:

- Reviewing which genres are currently in use
- Identifying duplicates or inconsistencies
- Planning metadata cleanup or standardization

This version is lightweight and perfect for quick genre audits.

## ðŸ“š Full Genres Report ##

The Full version goes deeper by aggregating all media items by genre. Youâ€™ll see:

- Each genre followed by a list of associated media
- Item-level details like title, release year, and library source
- A clear view of genre distribution across your entire collection

This report is especially useful for heavy users managing large libraries who want to analyze genre trends, spot underrepresented categories, or prepare for bulk metadata updates.
