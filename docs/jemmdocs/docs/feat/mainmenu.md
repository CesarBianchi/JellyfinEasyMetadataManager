# üñ•Ô∏è Exploring the Main Window of JEMM

Welcome to the heart of JEMM ‚Äì Jellyfin Easy Metadata Manager! The **Main Window** is where all the magic happens and where some commons functions are available. As soon as this window opens, JEMM automatically attempts to connect to your configured Jellyfin instance using the URL and API Key you provided during login. A few of data are dowloaded during this process, so the loading-time depends on the size of your Instance *(The quantity of libraries for example)*.

Once connected, JEMM fetches and displays all available libraries from your Jellyfin server, along with their metadata and content details. This gives you a complete overview of your media collection in one clean, organized interface.

The Main Window is thoughtfully **divided into five key sections**, each designed to help you manage your media with ease:

## The five sections of JEMM Main Menu ##
- [The Top Main Menu](/feat/topmainmenu/)
- [Libraries List](/feat/librarylist)
- [Library Metadata](/feat/librarymetadata)
- [Library Content](/feat/librarycontent)
- [Footer Status Bar](/feat/footerStatusBar)
