# 🖥️ Exploring the Main Window of JEMM

Welcome to the heart of JEMM – Jellyfin Easy Metadata Manager! The *Main Window* is where all the magic happens and where the most commons functions are availabre. As soon as this window opens, JEMM automatically attempts to connect to your configured Jellyfin instance using the URL and API Key you provided during login. A few of data are dowloaded during this process, so the loading-time depends on the size of your Instance *(The quantity of libraries for example)*.

Once connected, JEMM fetches and displays all available libraries from your Jellyfin server, along with their metadata and content details. This gives you a complete overview of your media collection in one clean, organized interface.

The Main Window is thoughtfully **divided into five key sections**, each designed to help you manage your media with ease:

## 1. The Top Menu – Your JEMM Toolbox ##

The Top Menu in JEMM is your gateway to essential features and tools that make metadata management smoother and more powerful. It’s designed to be intuitive, giving you quick access to everything you need—whether you're organizing your media, generating reports, or supporting the project.

Here’s what you’ll find in this menu:
 - Refresh Libraries List and Items;
 - Search Item;
 - Import & Export Tools;
 - Reports;
 - Shortcuts to Source Code, Donate Page and Users Manual;

## 2. 📚 Libraries List ##

On the left side of the window, you’ll see the Libraries List. This panel displays all the media libraries retrieved from your Jellyfin server—Movies, TV Shows, Music, Books, or any custom collections you’ve created.

Each library entry includes:

    The library name

    The type of content it holds

    A quick summary of its size and item count

Clicking on a library will load its metadata and content into the adjacent panels.

## 3. 📝 Library Metadata Sheet ##

Once a library is selected, the Library Metadata Sheet shows detailed information about that library’s configuration and metadata settings.

Here you can view and edit:

    Library title and description

    Metadata source settings

    Language preferences

    Image and artwork options

This sheet is perfect for fine-tuning how your media is presented and organized within Jellyfin.

## 4. 🎞️ Library Content Sheet ##

The Library Content Sheet is where you dive into the actual items within the selected library. It displays a list of media entries—movies, episodes, albums, etc.—along with key metadata fields such as:

    Title

    Release year

    Genres

    Cast and crew

    Artwork previews

You can sort, filter, and edit metadata directly from this panel, making it easy to keep your collection clean and accurate.

## 5. 📊 Foot Status Bar ##

At the bottom of the window, the Foot Status Bar keeps you informed. It displays real-time updates about:

    Connection status with Jellyfin

    Number of libraries loaded

    Current operations (e.g., metadata updates, sync progress)

    Any warnings or errors

It’s a subtle but powerful tool to ensure everything is running smoothly behind the scenes.
