## 5. ðŸ“Š Foot Status Bar ##

At the bottom of the window, the Foot Status Bar keeps you informed. It displays real-time updates about:

    Connection status with Jellyfin

    Number of libraries loaded

    Current operations (e.g., metadata updates, sync progress)

    Any warnings or errors

Itâ€™s a subtle but powerful tool to ensure everything is running smoothly behind the scenes.
