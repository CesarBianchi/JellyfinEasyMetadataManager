# 3. The "Library Metadata" sheet #

Once a library is selected, the Library Metadata Sheet shows detailed information about that **library configuration and metadata settings**. This sheet is perfect for fine-tuning how your LIBRARY is presented and organized within Jellyfin.

**Important to know:** This sheet does not display metadata details for **individual items within the library**. To view or edit metadata for specific media items â€” like movies, episodes, or albumsâ€”head over to the **Library Content** Grid. Thatâ€™s where youâ€™ll find all the detailed information for each item, including titles, genres, cast, artwork, and more.

### Here you can view and edit for Library: ###
- *Library Title*
- *Sort Name*
- *Forced Sort Name*
- *Created Date*
- *Premiere Date*
- *Custom Rating*
- *Overview*

### In addition to editing basic metadata, you can also fine-tune other aspects of your **Library**, such as: ####
- *People*;
- *Genres*;
- *Studios*;
- *Tags*;

Use the left buttons **+** and **-** to help you to add these specific items
