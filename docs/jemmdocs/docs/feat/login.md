# 🔐 Logging into JEMM

## How to connect JEMM with your Jellyfin Instance ?##
To start using JEMM – Jellyfin Easy Metadata Manager, you’ll need to connect it to your Jellyfin Instance. It’s quick and easy! Here’s what you’ll need:

**1 - Jellyfin Instance URL** 

Enter the full address of your Jellyfin server, including the port number.
    If you're using HTTP, the default port is usually 8096 *Example: http://192.168.0.100:8096* 
    If you're using HTTPS, the default port is typically 8920 *Example: https://yourdomain.com:8920*



**2 - Valid Jellyfin API Key**. 

You can generate your API Key from the Administration Panel in Jellyfin. Just go to Dashboard > API Keys, create a new one, and paste it into JEMM. Check also our help page about [How to Generate a Jellyfin API Key](/about/requirements/#jellyfin-api-key)

Once you’ve entered both, press "Login" button. JEMM will securely connect to your Jellyfin server and unlock all its metadata management features.
