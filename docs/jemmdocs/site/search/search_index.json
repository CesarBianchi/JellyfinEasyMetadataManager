This feature is built around two key functions: \ud83d\udce4 Export CSV Metadata With just a click, you can export all existing metadata from your Jellyfin libraries into a structured CSV file. This file includes detailed information about each item\u2014titles, genres, release years, cast, artwork links, and more. Why is this useful? You get a complete snapshot of your media metadata.
