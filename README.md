# JellyfinEasyMetadataManager

Jellyfin Easy Metadata Manager (Also called as "JEMM") is a free and open-source tool created to help heavy users of Jellyfin Project (https://jellyfin.org/) to manage their instances. 
The main purpose of JEMM is to make it easier to fill in the metadata fields of library items and folders. 

Recommended for managing the metadata fiels of private content not available on IMDb or TheMovieDb sources.

With JEMM, you can easily replicate the same metadata fields defined in a folder to the child-items.
