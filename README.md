# JellyfinEasyMetadataManager

Jellyfin Easy Metadata Manager (Also called as "JEMM") is a free and open-source desktop tool created to help heavy users of Jellyfin Project (https://jellyfin.org/) to manage their instances.
The main purpose of JEMM is to make it easier to fill in the metadata fields of library-items and libraries. 

Recommended for managing the metadata fields of private content not available on IMDb or TheMovieDb sources.

With JEMM, you can easily replicate the same metadata fields defined in a library to the child-items, export and import metadata from CSV files, print some reports about your media-inventory and others nice things! You can make just a little metadata update or make big changes massivelly!

## To download a runnable file
If you are not a developer or do not want to download the complete source-code and build it locally, you can do directly download the runnable file [jemm_runnable-jar-with-dependencies.jar](target/jemm_runnable-jar-with-dependencies.jar) (available at: root/target/jemm_runnable-jar-with-dependencies.jar). 
**Java version 11 is required on your machine and you will need able an Api Key - through the "Administration options" in your Jellyfin instance.**

## To build locally
If you are a developer, you can do download the project directly using your preferred git client. 
JEMM was built using Apache NetBeans IDE 19 and Java version 11, but you can use your preferred IDE.

## To create an Api Key in your Jellyfin Instance
1. Once in Jellyfin, navigate to the Jellyfin Dashboard by clicking the "hamburger" icon in the top left corner and click on Admin > Dashboard. 
2. In the left Navigation menu, scroll down to Advanced and click on Api Keys. 
3. Now click on the + button next to API Keys.
